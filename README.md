# Bullseye: Pygame Dart Game

## Project Overview
This project is a two-player, local co-op darts game developed using the **Pygame** library. It was created as the final project for an **Applied Python** class, demonstrating practical application of Python for game development, physics simulation, and external library integration.

The game features a moving dartboard, a skill-based strength meter, and complete scoring logic for a standard 101, 301, or 501 game, including "bust" detection.
